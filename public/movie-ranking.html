    <h3>A Slient Voice</h3>
        <p>
        I love this animated movie because I think it is a very good slice of life movie.<br />
        I also like the animation style.

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <p>
        I watched it for the first time on New Years day of 2025 and I cannot stop thinking about it.<br />
        It is very thought provoking.

    <h3>Marvel's Avengers End Game</h3>
        <p>
        This movie was every comic book readers dream.<br />
        I loved all the action and epic moments in the movie. This movie was an end to an era for the Marvel Cinmatic Universe.
